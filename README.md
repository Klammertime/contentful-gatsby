# Personal Portfolio Site

# Hi, I'm Audrey 👋

### This is the repo for my personal site, [audreyklammer.com](https://www.audreyklammer.com).

This site uses [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com/), the headless CMS [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), and hosting
platform
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I used Webflow for design ideas but created everything by hand using CSS, Styled Components, and React.

## Resources

### Contentful

[Official Contentful getting started guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/).

I originally used a basic Gatsby starter made by Contentful.
If you want to clone the starter I used, here is the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog.git
$ npm install
```

This site uses
the [synchronization feature](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/synchronization)
of the Contentful [Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/).

## Crucial Commands

### `npm run dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `npm run build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static host.

### `npm run serve`

Spin up a production-ready server
